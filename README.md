## Final Submission | 5/17/23

When I first started working on this news app, I would be lying if I said I wasn't intimidated. I encountered several challenges, but I ultimately created something I'm proud of. My news app allows users to explore and understand PFAS contamination across the United States. The app's two main components are a locator map and a table. The locator map shows known PFAS contamination sites in the U.S., using color coding to indicate the level of contamination. You can zoom in and out to see more or less detail, and use the search function to pan over to a specific address, county, state, or ZIP code. When users click on a dot, which represents a single PFAS site, a popup will show additional information about the site including the site's name, its address, and the level of PFAS detected in nanograms per liter. The table displays the data in a more readable way with sortable columns. A user may want to sort by contamination level, for example, to examine the sites with the highest levels of PFAS. Users can also use the search bar to filter the data and find sites that interest them the most.

Before designing what my app would look like, I extracted some Census demographics, such as race/ethnicity and median income in R. I then merged the Census data with the original dataset by state, county, and ZIP code. This is, unfortunately, where I started encountering some problems. Even after geocoding the original dataset, there were too many missing values, which made it difficult to accurately analyze the demographics in a fair and unbiased way. This is when I decided to stray away from relying on the analysis and instead build a more exploratory app based on the original dataset. 

After building my templates and adjusting my repository's file structure, I worked on coding the locator map using the folium package. Although I have worked with folium before to make heatmaps, this was my first time building this type of map. It was challenging at first, but I got the hang of it through trial and error. The part I struggled with the most was color coding the markers and adding the legend. ChatGPT was somewhat helpful, but the [official Folium documentation](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) and this [tutorial](https://python-charts.com/spatial/interactive-maps-folium/) helped me the most. 

Once my map was in good shape, I started working on implementing jQuery's DataTables plugin into my index.html template. While adding DataTables wasn't difficult, I had a hard time getting the data to appear in the table correctly. I was able to get it to work in a separate script, but I didn't quite understand how to add the data/table to my index.html template. I learned that the reason why it wasn‚Äôt working initially was because I was only rendering the template, which was empty. I had to make sure that the route and its function was actually getting called. To fix this problem, I assembled the data I needed for the table in my index function and loaded the table template in my index.html template. 

Overall, building this app was a fun challenge that allowed me to learn new skills and create an interactive tool that can help people understand and explore PFAS contamination in a more accessible and user-friendly way.

### Deployment & Maintenance üõ†Ô∏è

My app must be deployed via codespaces by running "python app.py" in the terminal. In the future, this app can be made available through GitHub Pages, but I have to figure out how to properly freeze the locator map so it remains useable and interactive. Users can download the data as a CSV by clicking on the "Download CSV" link under the map. This will redirect users to the raw version of the CSV where they can save the file to their device. 

The update schedule for this app would depend on the frequency of new data being released by the PFAS Project Lab at Northeastern University. The data was last updated in October 2022. It's possible that the lab will update their dataset around the same time this year, which is when I would schedule an update. Ideally, updates would be done incrementally to ensure that the app remains functional and user-friendly at all times. However, if there are significant changes to the data format or structure, wholesale updates may be necessary to ensure that the app is compatible with the new data.

If the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency were to publish a more centralized dataset that is more up-to-date and reliable, I would likely switch to that data instead of relying on the PFAS Project Lab. Alternatively, I would merge the datasets while ensuring duplicates are not included to provide a more comprehensive look at PFAS contamination. This would help ensure that the data I am using is accurate, complete, and trustworthy.
